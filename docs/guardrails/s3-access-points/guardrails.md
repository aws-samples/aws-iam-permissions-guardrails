If it has been created incorrectly, the only method is to delete the access point and create a new access point.                                                                                                                           | Check the VPC value provided in the API call payload for creating access point is a valid VPC in the account specified.                                         | [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/creating-access-points.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/creating-access-points.html)<br><br>                                               | s3:CreateAccessPoint<br><br>        |
