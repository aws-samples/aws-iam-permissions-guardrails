| IAM-KMS-1    | Check that the root principal is included in the KMS Key Policy.                                                                                     | Key lockout will occur if there are no principals that have access to the key policy. For example, say only IAM users or IAM Roles or included in the key policy. If the IAM users and IAM Roles are either deleted or they are removed from the key policy, no principal has access to the key policy. Ensuring root is included on the key policy means that in exceptional circumstances the root user can reestablish delegation to the appropriate IAM Role. This is not recommending daily or frequent root usage, rather this root is included as a precautionary measure for exceptional circumstances. The AWS Account root user is included with all created AWS Accounts. Root user is superadmin and can’t be deleted. | Add root principal to key policy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html#key-policy-default-allow-root-enable-iam](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html#key-policy-default-allow-root-enable-iam)<br><br>[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html#key-policy-default](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html#key-policy-default)<br><br>[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_root-user.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_root-user.html)<br><br> | KMS Key Policy |                                       |

Deletes key material that you previously imported. This operation makes the specified customer master key (CMK) unusable until the key material is reimported. All encrypted data is unreadable and unable to be decrypted until the customer reimports the exact same key material. A decision should be made if any break-glass roles should have this capability. These authorized roles should be whitelisted and all other rules should trigger a violation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Permission kms:DeleteImportedKeyMaterial should only be for authorized principals.

When a CMK is deleted, all data that was encrypted under the CMK is unrecoverable. Even in development this can be disruptive as there might be unnecessary downtime. The preventive control is to avoid ununauthorized capability of deleting CMKs. Relying on the 7 day waiting period and notificatons require appropriate detective controls.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Permission kms:ScheduleKeyDeletion should only be for authorized principals.
