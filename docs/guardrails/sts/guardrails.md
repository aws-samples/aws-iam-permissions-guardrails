It also provides a way for the account owner to permit the role to be assumed only under specific circumstances. The primary function of the external ID is to address and prevent the “confused deputy” problem. The external ID addresses the confused deputy problem by preventing any other customer from tricking the third party into unwittingly accessing your resources.                                                                                                                                                                                   | Add the condition sts:ExternalId.                                                                                                                                               | [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.html#condition-keys-sourcearn](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.html#condition-keys-sourcearn)<br><br>[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-using-identity-based-policies.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-using-identity-based-policies.html)<br><br> | Trust Policy |               |

When developers are able to create roles, they can control the contents of the Assume Role Policy Document, meaning they can create a cross account role for any account they know the account number to. It is important to understand what cross account roles exist within your organization, and who is allowed access to assume those roles.                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Compare allowed principals to a whitelist of pre-approved accounts within the Org or whitelisted by the customer InfoSec Team (Third party Vendor accounts that require access) | [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_principal.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_principal.html)<br><br>[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_common-scenarios_third-party.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_common-scenarios_third-party.html)<br><br>                                                                                       | Trust Policy |               |
