  "Identifier": "IAM-RDS-1",
  "Guardrail": "Check for separation of duties for administration of KMS keys and capability to perform encryption operations of the KMS Keys.",
  "Rationale": "Enabling encryption at rest for Amazon RDS or Amazon Aurora does not require the database administrator to have encrypt and decrypt capability. Over-privileged database administrator that are able to administrate the database as well as having KMS key access would be able to decrypt and view database encrypted data, such as backups.",
  "Remediation": "Separate out the privileges of database administration and access to the KMS keys. Create a Key Administrator Role for Create, Describe, List, Get. The RDS Service can have Encrypt, Decrypt, CreateGrants Actions using the condition keys kms:CallerAccount and kms:ViaService.",
