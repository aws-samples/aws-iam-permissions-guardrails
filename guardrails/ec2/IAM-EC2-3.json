  "Guardrail": "Check that all network modification permissions are granted to authorized roles only, ideally the AWS Account provisioning role.",
  "Rationale": "For all environments it is important to maintain and manage authorized network permitters and boundaries. Unauthorized network modifications could expose the network or service to attacks or data exfiltration. These actions are commonly associated with account provisioning rather than daily or frequent usage.",
  "Remediation": "Scope the following network infrastructure actions only to the AWS Account provisioning role.",
